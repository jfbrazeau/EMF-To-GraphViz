<h1>Ecore Diagrams</h1>

<h2>Eclipse Mode</h2>

<p>Emf2gv is classically used to represent EMF models. But as anybody who works with EMF has to use Ecore resources. That is why a specific <em>Graphical Description</em> has been created and embedded to emf2gv ready to use with any EMF Ecore model.</p>

<p>To use this feature, one simply has to right click on an Ecore resource, and select <strong>Run As > EMF To Graphviz Transformation</strong> in the popup menu.</p>

<p>As an illustration, here is the diagram that emf2gv generates for the graphdesc model itself :</p>

<h2>Standalone Mode</h2>

<p>If you plan to use this feature in a standalone application, you will have to use the graphical description that emf2gv uses. A wizard will help you to retrieve this file by doing the following actions :
<ol>
	<li>Menu <strong>File > New > Other...</strong></li>
	<li>Select <strong>EMF Tools > Sample Graphical Description for Ecore Models</strong></li>
	<li>Choose a filename</li>
</ol>
