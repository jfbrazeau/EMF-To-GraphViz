<h1>Containers</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>It is possible to represent the <em>EClass</em> node as containers (or <em>cluster nodes</em> if we use the Graphviz terminology). Child nodes will then appear as nested figures.</p>

<p>To do this, you simply have to select the <em>EReferences</em> that you want to be used to select the nested nodes (through the <code>nestedFiguresEReferences</code> property of the corresponding <em>ClassFigure</em>.</p>

<p>Be aware that only containment references are allowed, and once an <em>EReference</em> as been choosen in the nested figures, it cannot be chosen in a <em>ReferenceFigure</em> of the same <em>ClassFigure</em>.</p>

<h2>Example #1 (basic)</h2>

<p>For example, with the school sample, if we decide to select the students <em>EReference</em> in the <code>Classroom</code>'s <em>ClassFigure</em>, we get this result :

<i>Note : the <em>AttributeFigures</em> of the <code>Classroom</code>'s <em>ClassFigure</em> have also been removed.</i>

<h2>Example #2 (nested containers)</h2>

<p>If we eve, decide to select the classrooms <em>EReference</em> in the <code>School</code>'s <em>ClassFigure</em>, we get this result :
