<h1>Using DPO With Others...</h1>

<p>We have seen that <em>Dynamic Property Overriders</em> allow to override properties like  <a href="dpoWithColors.html">Colors</a>, <a href="dpoWithEdgeStyles.html">Edge Styles</a>, <a href="dpoWithArrowTypes.html">Arrow Types</a> or <a href="dpoWithFontStyles.html">Font Styles</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, it is also possible to override string properties or integer properties. Unlike the previous types, there is nothing to explain about overriding an string or integer property. If you have understood how to do with the advanced types (Colors, Arrow types, ...), working with string and integers is almost the same in a simplier way.</p>

<p>Never forget that you can reference the <code>defaultPropertyValue</code> in the OCL expressions which allow you not to duplicate an information that has already been entered statically in a figure's property.</p>
